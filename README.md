## A scoreboard for your game room in meteor

I used to keep a scoreboard on my door. It was a grid with some player names in columns and some game names in rows and
tally marks in the appropriate cell intersections.

I moved and that scoreboard got lost.

I wanted one that I could back up. 

I wanted to teach myself [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).

This project (in the early stages yet, unsuitable for any but the simplest use case) is my answer to both issues.
